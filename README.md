# AxcessIrelandApp2
AxcessApplication
This application is to develop a mobile application that provides information about the asylum process in Ireland and how to access the necessary information to enter and apply for refugee status in Ireland. 
The code was developed using react-native, which is an open source library to develop App's. We used Expo for IOS devices and Andriod Studio for Android devices where we could look at the code and design as we developed the App. This gave us live changes as they were made so we could track the workings of the application and fix any bugs or error as they occured.
Metro bundler was used on the web we could see the progress throuhg the local host. NPM start in the terminal started the App and to view on the simulators we typed i for ios, a for android and w for web.

This is a work in progress and we will continue to develop the App. The first phase is to show how we can put in pressable componenets to allow clicks to navigate through the different pages.
The next phse is to make the links to the different resources and web sites.
